Automobile Sales Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard built with Dash and Plotly to visualize and analyze historical automobile sales data from 1980 to 2023. The dashboard enables users to explore yearly and recession period statistics through dynamic filters and various chart types (line, bar, pie), providing actionable insights on sales trends, advertising expenditure, and economic impacts like unemployment rates. This project demonstrates my skills in data visualization, Python web app development, and data-driven storytelling.

# Key Highlights
Developed a dynamic dashboard using Python Dash and Plotly for interactive data visualization of automobile sales trends.

Integrated real-world historical data and provided insightful visual analytics on yearly and recession period statistics.

Implemented responsive UI components including dropdown menus for user-driven filtering and selection.

Visualized complex relationships using multiple chart types: line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, and pie charts for share distribution.

Employed Pandas for data cleaning and aggregation, enabling efficient real-time filtering and grouping.

Demonstrated ability to deploy and troubleshoot Dash applications locally and adapt for remote hosting.

Showcased proficiency in combining data analytics and full-stack Python development for business intelligence solutions.


# Project Objectives

Develop an interactive dashboard to display automobile sales statistics for both yearly and recession periods.

Enable dynamic filtering with dropdown menus to select the type of statistics and specific years.

Visualize data through multiple chart types, including line charts (trends over time), bar charts (comparisons across categories), and pie charts (proportional expenditure shares).

Implement efficient data grouping and aggregation using pandas to support real-time updates based on user input.

Highlight economic insights, such as the impact of unemployment rates on vehicle sales and advertising expenditure distribution.

Design a clean, user-friendly UI with clear titles and labels to improve user experience and comprehension.

Deploy and test the dashboard locally with a focus on scalability for future cloud hosting.
